<hr><h1>Progress since launch of Synergy</h1> 
<section id="progress">
    <div>
    <p>In India, the required vegetation or forest cover is 33% of the total land area. However, due to extensive deforestation, mining, and other detrimental activities,
 this has plummeted to 21.47%. Our website aims to address this issue gradually, with a
 projected increase to 22%. While seemingly modest, even this incremental change holds 
 importance in our efforts to restore and preserve our natural ecosystems.</p></div>
