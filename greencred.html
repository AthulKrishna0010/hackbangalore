            <p>In India, the required vegetation or forest cover is 33% of the total land area. However, due to extensive deforestation, mining, and other detrimental activities,
         this has plummeted to 21.47%. Our website aims to address this issue gradually, with a
         projected increase to 22%. While seemingly modest, even this incremental change holds 
         importance in our efforts to restore and preserve our natural ecosystems.</p></div>
